                <p><span className="about-me-title">I've always loved a challenge.</span><br /><br />

                    <span>Science and music have always been my passion. Both bring a sense of challenge and need for practice. I've always been pushed to be the best I can be.</span><br /><br />
                    
                    <span>So naturally, I went to college (Florida Southern) to get a degree in biology and pursue medical school. I quickly found out that this path was not mine.</span><br /><br />
                    
                    <span>After my bachelor's, I went to the University of South Florida for a master's in medical science. Realizing the exponential growth of the clinical research industry, I got a job as a coordinator at a local site.</span><br /><br />
                    
                    <span>Spending a year as a coordinator taught me about clinical research and prepared me for my next job as a vendor specialist for a large network of sites.</span><br /><br />
                    
                    <span>I found one thing to be my favorite part about both of these jobs: I created an excel app that helped me do my job better.</span><br /><br />
                    
                    <span>I decided to begin teaching myself how to code using any resources I could find, creating projects and websites on my own.</span><br /><br />

                    <span>Now my goal is to help others by building them tools to help them do their jobs easier.</span><br /><br />

                    <span>My background is mainly scientific, specifically in lab and clinical research work, however, I am a quick learner and easy to work with.</span><br /><br />

                    <span>I will work to bring your ideas to life exactly how you envision them.</span><br /><br />
