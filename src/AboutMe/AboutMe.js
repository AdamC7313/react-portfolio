                <p><div className="about-me-title">I've always loved a challenge.</div><br />

                    <div>Science and music have always been my passion. 
                        Both bring a sense of challenge and need for practice. 
                        I've always been pushed to be the best I can be.</div><br />
                    
                    <div>So naturally, I went to college (Florida Southern) to 
                        get a degree in biology and pursue medical school. I quickly 
                        found out that this path was not mine.</div><br />
                    
                    <div>After my bachelor's, I went to the University of South 
                        Florida for a master's in medical science. Realizing the 
                        exponential growth of the clinical research industry, I got 
                        a job as a coordinator at a local site.</div><br />
                    
                    <div>Spending a year as a coordinator taught me about 
                        clinical research and prepared me for my next job as a 
                        vendor specialist for a large network of sites.</div><br />
                    
                    <div>I found one thing to be my favorite part about both 
                        of these jobs: I created an excel app that helped me do 
                        my job better.</div><br />
                    
                    <div>I decided to begin teaching myself how to code using any 
                        resources I could find, creating projects and websites on 
                        my own.</div><br />

                    <div>Now my goal is to help others by building them tools to 
                        help them do their jobs easier.</div><br />

                    <div>My background is mainly scientific, specifically in lab and 
                        clinical research work, however, I am a quick learner and
                         easy to work with.</div><br />

                    <div>I will work to bring your ideas to life exactly how you 
                        envision them.</div><br />
